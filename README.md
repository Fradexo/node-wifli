## What is?

Interactive Toy Concepts makes this thing called a [Wi-Fly](http://www.interactivetoy.com/IATC1011/home/index.html). JIFASNIF, therefore here's a pretty simpleminded wrapper in Node to control the copter.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to already have the controlling PC on the SSID for the Wi-Fly.
That's about it! For now, read the source for the details, or look at the
trivial example in the examples folder.
