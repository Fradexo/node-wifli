## What is?

Interactive Toy Concepts makes this thing called a
[Wi-Fly](http://www.interactivetoy.com/IATC1011/home/index.html). JIFASNIF,
therefore here's an increasingly less simpleminded wrapper in Node to control
the copter.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to already have the controlling computer on the SSID for the Wi-Fly.
That's about it! For now, read the source for the details, or look at the
examples and tests.
